TOP Landing Page

Going to set up the landing page for the Odin Project exercise. I will exercise the skills I have learned from the flex exercises from the 
previous modules and create a landing page with the current knowledge I have obtained.

Forgot to commit and I just finished the project. Looking back, I was heavily struggling with the concept of flexbox in general. When I 
initially started this project a couple of weeks ago, I was frustrated and felt overwhelmed at where to start and such. Having come back
to this project exercise again with a clear mind, I changed up my approach and actually was able to do a much better job than my first time.

I broke each section down to managable parts and tackled each one specifically until I finished each section. Followed the directions and 
worked on the HTML portions first before going on to the CSS parts. While it is not perfect and there are definitely still a lot of room
for improvemnts, I am happy with how it turned out overall. I even enjoyed the process of building this project. It was challenging but
still achievable for me to do.
